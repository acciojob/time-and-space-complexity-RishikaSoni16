	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is essentially efficient, or how long a program function takes to process a given input.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is essentially a parallel concept to time complexity. If you need to create an array of size n, this will take <span>O(n)</span> space.</p>
